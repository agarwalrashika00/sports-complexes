Sports Complexes

There are various branches of sports complexes, example - Vikaspuri, Janakpuri etc.

User can take coaching of multiple sports from the the sports complexes.

User can enroll into multiple coachings. Each sports coaching has batches(6pm to 7pm, 7pm to 8pm etc). User can atmost enroll to one batch of a particular sport in a particular branch.

For simplicity, let's assume that coaching can only be monthly. Coaching will always start on 1st and end on last day of the month. User can only enroll in coaching of current month. Coaching of future cannot be booked. 

The timings of coachings selected by a user should not clash.

However user can take coaching of same sport in two different branches.

You've to store data for all the users and the coachings they are taking.

You also have to store the time in which the coachings for a particular sport are being held

Assume that there are 5 sports - cricket, tennis, badminton, squash, table tennis.

Example to understand the requirements better

I can take coaching of tennis in dwarka, cricket in dwarka, and tennis in vikaspuri as long as my timings don't clash with each other.
